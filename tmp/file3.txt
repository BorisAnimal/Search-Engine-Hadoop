His main instrument was the guitar. His name was misspelled \"Conny Veidt\" in Gila's first album.\n\nLittle is known about Conny's life. In 1969 he founded Gila and, in 1971, recorded their first album, Free Electric Sound, one of the best and influential albums of all times. In 1972 he joined Popol Vuh for a short period.\n\nAccording to Conny, as for myself, in 1972, aged 21, I decided to move to Munich, because Popol Vuh’s Florian Fricke had invited me to collaborate on his new LP Hosianna Mantra. I had accepted the offer, yet I didn't want to leave Gila because Popol Vuh was a pure studio project. Anyway for me, it was not until I took that step that my life as a professional musician began.\n\nIn 1973 he released the second Gila album, Bury my heart at wounded knee, with a new line-up featuring Daniel Fichelscher, Florian Fricke, Conny and his girlfriend Sabine Merbach. The second Gila iteration didn't have much of a lifespan either. Seemingly uninterested in touring, the band's focus splinted with Fichelscher and Fricke returning to Popol Vuh. For his part, Veit began working with Amon Duul II, before briefly hooking up with Guru Guru. He later turned his attention to painting. Suffering from alcoholism, Merbach died from liver failure.\n\nDaniel Fichelscher once stated that Conny was my best friend, I will never forget how we played 8 days a week.\n\nAfter the intensive work for Hosianna Mantra Conny Veit toured in France with Amon Duul II during the winter of 1973-1974 with Chis Karrer, John Weinzierl, Peter Leopold, Ncik Woodland, Andy Vix and Jutta Weinhold.\n\nDuring 1985 and 1986 he was member of a band called Coney Island, under the name of Coney Fight.\n\nIn August 1999, Conny wrote to Wolf-Reinhart Kotzsch (owner of Second Battle recording company), stating that he had found suitable musicians for a new line-up of Gila, with whom he wanted to overdub some tracks recorded in their rehearsal studio in the eighties, which had not been released at that point in time. In Conny's view, the tapes were very interesting, because they offered a view about the possible development of the group at that period, if that should ever have materialized. In Hamburg I found some motivated musicians with close contacts to Berlin to bring Gila back to life again. There are some valuable tapes, although the material is not known to the public.\n\nUnfortunately, Second Battle couldn't get the project off the ground, because the label had to endure a lot of problems, like\nthe insolvencies of business partners and the bootleg pirates, who have flooded the market of Progressive Rock for years and\nalso destroyed more than one fellow company. Walter Nowicki released Gila's second album officially, so Conny had the chance to beat the bloodsucking \"rip-off-managers\" for once, just before his sad and untimely death.\n\nIn 2008, Second Battle released the album Free Electric Rock Sessions, live in Koln 1972.\n"}

It was to be located close to the original centre of Morden village in the London Borough of Merton, in south-west London.\n\nThe station was to have been built on the W&SR's planned surface railway line in Surrey (now south-west London) from Wimbledon to Sutton. The station was to be on the south side of Central Road. The construction of the railway was approved in 1910. In 1911 the UERL agreed to provide funding for the line's construction and to operate its train services by extending the UERL's District Railway (DR) from Wimbledon station.\n\nDelays in the purchase of land along the railway's route and the outbreak of war prevented the works from commencing and the permission was extended several times with a final extension granted in 1922. Following the war, the UERL presented new proposals to construct an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR, now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden in tunnel where it would come to the surface and join the W&SR route. Both DR and C&SLR trains would run to Sutton.\nThe first C&SLR station to the north was to be named \"North Morden\" and the W&SR station near the village was to be named \"South Morden\". The plan to extend the C&SLR was opposed by the Southern Railway (SR), the operator of the mainline services through Wimbledon and Sutton. A settlement between the companies agreed that the extension of the C&SLR would end at North Morden (which opened as plain \"Morden\") and the W&SR would be taken over and its route would be constructed by the SR. \n\nWhen the Wimbledon to Sutton line was constructed by the SR in the late 1920s, Morden village station was omitted and replaced with Morden South to the north adjacent to London Road and St Helier to the south on Green Lane.\n\n"}

The viaduct is 2 miles in length and carries the South Western Main Line into Waterloo. Initially constructed in 1848, the viaduct begins in eastern Battersea in Nine Elms and with an intermediate station at Vauxhall incorporated within the viaduct, the viaduct terminates at Waterloo Railway Station. The viaduct comprises six iron girder bridges, with a combined weight of 800 tons, and over 290 arches (excluding those beneath the Waterloo Bridge terminus). The brick sections of the viaduct are composed of some 80,000,000 bricks. The viaduct is managed by Network Rail, who in turn lease many of the arches for commercial, retail and industrial use.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the original London and South Western Railway terminus was located at Nine Elms on the south-western edge of what was then the urban limit of developed London. To facilitate easier entrance for goods and passengers into central London, the railway sought a “Metropolitan Extension” from Nine Elms to Waterloo Bridge. A four-track extension was authorised by an Act of Parliament on 31 July 1845 with a supplementary Act of 1847 providing an additional two tracks; the capital authorised was estimated at £800,000. The work was carried out under the direction of the engineer Joseph Locke. Running through the ancient parishes of Battersea and Lambeth the construction was reported to have displaced about 700 houses. It dissected the areas of Vauxhall and Lambeth, creating an artificial divide. Passage underneath the viaduct is obtained through one of the many tunnels constructed underneath the viaduct for street level access. It was stated that one glassworks, one engineering works, the Royal Swimming Baths and a church; All Saints Church were all demolished for the construction of the viaduct. However, the viaduct was built to avoid some major landmarks at the time, including the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens and Lambeth Palace and for this reason does not follow a straight route to Waterloo.\n\nThe opening of the viaduct and line was planned for 30 June 1848, but the Board of Trade Inspector did not approve some of the large-span bridges at the eastern end, however his superior was satisfied by later load tests, and the line opened on 11 July 1848. Further widening of the viaduct took place between 1877 and 1868 and again from 1898, when an eight-track railway all the way through from Waterloo to Clapham Junction was completed (taking until 1910 to be fully completed).\nThe viaduct still has two railway stations, the first is an intermediate station at Vauxhall incorporated within the viaduct and the second is the terminus at London Waterloo. The Nine Elms station was discontinued upon the opening of the Waterloo station.\n"}

The process contain the following four steps.\n\nThe \"template\" can be created by either photolithography or e-beam lithography to define binding sites for various building blocks. The binding sites should reflect the foot print of the building blocks or clusters to be bound.\n\nAfter film development, the created pattern is treated with charged polymers in order to “stick” the particles. Take poly-lysine as an example, the poly-lysine will cover the negatively charged glass surface and turn the charge to be positive; it thus can non-specifically bind negatively charged metallic nanoparticles.\n\nTo do particle assembly, treated pattern is submerged in a small amount of aqueous solution of particles. A few approaches can be used to facilitate the binding efficiency. One of them is to use capillary force at the edge of the aqueous droplet to “push” the particles into the binding sites. If assembling multiple types of particles, the particles should be assembled in the order of decreasing sizes. For example, if assembling both 60 nm gold nanoparticles as well as 40 nm silver nanoparticles, 60 nm gold nanoparticles should be applied first because it is too big to enter binding sites tailored for 40 nm particles. Rationally design the binding sequence as well as the binding site sizes can minimize the binding errors from occurring.\n\nAfter binding of all building blocks, the template can be removed by either dissolving in an organic solvent, or stripped off by a scotch tape. \n"}
