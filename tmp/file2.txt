At the outset of World War I, Hāzners' family became refugees in 1915, finding a new home in Valka, however, Hāzners' schooling was interrupted. Following the war, he resumed his studies after his family's return, graduating from the Jelgava Agricultural High School, then working for several years at the Vidsmuiža Livestock Research Station. In 1926 he was called up for compulsory military service in the Latvian army, joining the 3rd Jelgava Infantry Regiment. The military was considered a good career; Hāzners determined to become a professional soldier. He entered the Latvian Military Academy in 1928, graduating in 1931, and was then deployed to join the 7th Sigulda Infantry Regiment stationed in Aluksne. Hāzners was promoted to Lieutenant in 1934 on Latvian Independence Day (November 18). In September 1936 he requested and was granted a transfer to the 6th Riga Infantry Regiment. In 1939 he was sent to the highest military academy, graduating in 1940 with a rank of Captain. In March, 1940 Hāzners was appointed a military training instructor at the Rīga Rainis Gymnasium. On June 12, 1940 he was awarded a Class V Order of Viesturs. He was relieved of military service upon the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940.\n\nAfter Germany launched its invasion of the U.S.S.R. on 21 June 1941, the KGB in Rīga took Hāzners in on June 25, ostensibly for a brief interview. However, arriving at the KGB station, Hāzners was arrested and isolated. The KGB questioned him and demanded he identify anti-Soviet elements, but Hāzners refused. He was taken away and incarcerated at the Central Prison, where he was threatened, beaten, and forced to affix his signature to his own death sentence. Fortunately, Hāzners and several other prisoners managed to escape on June 30 as the Soviets began their retreat ahead of the German capture of Rīga the following day.\n\nAfter a year of brutal occupation, the arrival of the Germans was initially greeted as a liberation for the Latvians. The Latvian national anthem played on the radio. Hāzners joined partisan forces along the Vidzeme shore insuring the Russian retreat was complete. Hāzners subsequently performed adjutant duties for Colonel Voldemars Veiss. He became involved in coordinating Latvian military participation in front-lines combat on the Eastern Front. In October 1942 Hāzners was appointed county chief of Abrene.\n\nHāzners resigned his county position in May, 1943 and joined the Latvian Legion, 15. Grenadier SS Armed Division (Latvian No. 1), 32. Regiment as regiment commander adjutant. He was appointed commander of I. Battalion on 6 March 1944 but reassigned as commander of III. Battalion on 13 April. That mid-July the 32. Regiment was forced to retreat from positions in Opochka along the banks of the Velikaya River; the battalion was reorganized as part of the Kārlis Aperāts battle group. On 18 July 1944, battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Aperāts was mortally wounded in battle near the town of Mozulyu and handed his command over to Hāzners, who with the five dozen or so surviving soldiers and officers he now led managed to cross a swamp and break out from the Russian forces surrounding them. For his heroism, Hāzners was awarded the Ehrenblatt des Heeres.\n\nOn 20 August 1944, Hāzners was redeployed to Germany with the remnants of 32. Regiment, where he was promoted to the rank of major and appointed commander of the 15. Fusiliers Battalion. On 26 January 1945, Hāzners was wounded in action at Immenheim and sent to Denmark for recovery, where he remained until the end of the war.\n\nFollowing the war, Hāzners was housed with other Latvian POWs at the Zedelgem POW Camp, where he was one of the founders of the Daugavas Vanagi welfare organization. Subsequently he participated in training war invalids, helping approximately 500 take up useful trades and occupations.\n\nHāzners was active in the exile Latvian-American community. He served as the president of the Latvian National Committee (1948-1951), from 1951 editing the \"Daugavas Vanagi\" monthly newsletter, eventually serving as the organization's general-secretary.\n\nIn 1977, based on KGB-fabricated documents, Hāzners was accused of active participation in the Holocaust. However neither the INS nor Justice Department Office of Special Investigation (OSI) were able to provide evidence.\n\nHāzners died 12 May 1989 in the United States and his remains buried in Latvia in Bērzkrogs Cemetery.\n\n"}

{"id": "54287898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54287898", "title": "Alchon Huns", "text": "Alchon Huns\n\nThe Alchon Huns (Sanskrit: Hūṇas), also Alkhan Huns, were a group of nomads who established states in central and southern Asia. They were part of the four major \"Hunic\" states known collectively as Xionites or \"Hunas\", being preceded in southern Asia by the Kidarites and the Hephthalites, and succeeded by the Nezak Huns. \n\nThe Alchons appeared in the Paropamisus and later expanded into the Punjab and central India as far as Eran and Kausambi. Their invasion of Indian territory follows that of the Kidarites about half a century earlier. It greatly weakened, and contributed to the fall of, the Gupta Empire. Their invasion of India follows numerous other invasions in the preceding centuries, such as those of the Indo-Greeks, the Indo-Scythians or the Kushans.\n\nWe know of the names of the Alchon kings from their extensive coinage and from inscriptions in Buddhist stupas. \n\nThe Alchon Huns emerged in Kapisa around 380, taking over Kabulistan from the Sassanian Persians, at the same time the Kidarites (Red Huns) ruled in Bactria and Ghandara. They are said to have taken control of Kabul in 388.\n\nAround 430 king Khingila, the most notable Alchon ruler, emerges and takes control of the routes across the Hindu Kush from the Kidarites. As the Alchons Huns took control, diplomatic missions were established in 457 with China. In 460, the Alchons conquered Taxila. Between 460-470 CE, as they took over Gandhara and Punjab, the Huns apparently undertook the mass destruction of Buddhist monasteries and stupas at Taxila, a high center of learning, which never recovered from the destruction. The rest of the 5th century marks a period of territorial expansion and eponymous kings (Tegins), several of which appear to have overlapped and ruled jointly.\n\nIn the First Hunnic War (496-515), the Alchon Huns reached their maximum territorial extent, with king Toramana pushing deep into Indian territory, reaching Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh in Central India, and ultimately contributing to the downfall of the Gupta Empire. \n\nTo the south, the Sanjeli inscriptions indicate that Toramana penetrated at least as far as northern Gujarat , and possibly to the port of Bharukaccha. To the east, far into Central India, the city of Kausambi, where seals with Toramana's name were found, was probably sacked by the Alkhons in 497-500, before they moved to occupy Malwa. \n\nThese territories may have been taken from Gupta Emperor Budhagupta. Alternatively, they may have been captured during the rule of his successor Narasimhagupta. \n\nA particularly decisive encounter occurred in Malwa, where a local Gupta ruler, probably a Governor, named Bhanugupta was in charge. In the \"Bhanugupta Eran inscription\", this local ruler reports that he participated in a great battle in 510 CE at Eran, where he suffered severe casualties. Bhanugupta was probably vanquished by Toramana at this 510 CE Eran battle, so that the western Gupta province of Malwa fell into the hands of the Hunas at that point.\n\nAccording to a 6th century CE Buddhist work, the \"Manjusri-mula-kalpa\", Bhanugupta lost Malwa to the \"Shudra\" Toramana, who continued his conquest to Magadha, forcing Narasimhagupta Baladitya to make a retreat to Bengal. Toramana \"possessed of great prowess and armies\" then conquered the city of \"Tirtha\" in the Gauda country (modern Bengal). Toramana is said to have crowned a new king in Benares, named Prakataditya, who is also presented as a son of Narasimha Gupta. \n\nHaving conquered the territory of Malwa from the Guptas, Toramana was mentionned in a famous inscription in Eran, confirming his rule on the region. The \"Eran boar inscription of Toramana\" (in Eran, Malwa, 540 km south of New Delhi, state of Madhya Pradesh) of his first regnal year indicates that eastern Malwa was included in his dominion. The inscription is written under the neck of the boar, in 8 lines of Sanskrit in the Brahmi script. The first line of the inscription, in which Toramana is introduced as \"Mahararajadhidaja\" (\"The Great King of Kings\"), reads:\n\nOn his gold coins minted in India in the style of the Gupta Emperors, Toramana presented himself confidently as:\nToramana was finally defeated by local Indian rulers. The local ruler Bhanugupta is sometimes credited with vanquishing Toramana, as his 510 CE inscription in Eran, recording his participation to \"a great battle\", is vague enough to allow for such an interpretation. The \"great battle\" to which Bhanagupta participated according to the inscription is not detailed, and it is impossible to know what it was, or which way it ended, and interpretations vary. Mookerji and others actually consider, in view of the inscription as well as the Manjusri-mula-kalpa, that Bhanugupta was, on the contrary, vanquished by Toramana at the 510 CE Eran battle, so that the western Gupta province of Malwa fell into the hands of the Hunas at that point, so that Toramana could be mentioned in the Eran boar inscription, as the ruler of the region. \n\nToramana however was finally vanquished with certainty by an Indian ruler of the Aulikara dynasty of Malwa, after nearly 20 years in India. According to the Rishtal stone-slab inscription, discovered in 1983, king Prakashadharma defeated Toramana in 515 CE. The First Hunnic War thus ended with a Hunnic defeat, and Hunnic troops apparently retreated to the area of Punjab. The Manjusri-mula-kalpa simply states that Toramana died in Benares as he was returning westward from his battles with Narasimhagupta.\n\nThe Second Hunnic War started in 520, when Alchon king Mihirakula, son of Toramana, is recorded in his military encampment on the borders of the Jhelum by Chinese monk Song Yun. \n\nAt the head of the Alkhon Huns, Mihirakula is then recorded in Gwalior, Central India as \"Lord of the Earth\" in the Gwalior inscription of Mihirakula. According to some accounts, Mihirakula invaded India as far as the Gupta capital Pataliputra, which was sacked and left in ruins.\nFinally however, Mihirakula was defeated in 528 by an alliance of Indian principalities led by Yasodharman, the Aulikara king of Malwa, in the battle of Sondani in Central India, which resulted in the loss of Alchon possessions in the Punjab and north India by 542. The Sondani inscription in Sondani, near Mandsaur, records the submission by force of the Hunas, and claim that Yasodharman had rescued the earth from \"rude and cruel kings of the [Kali] age, who delight in viciousness\", and that he \"had bent the head of Mihirakula\". In a part of the inscription at Sondani, Yasodharman thus praises himself for having defeated king Mihirakula:\n\nThe Gupta Empire emperor Narasimhagupta is also credited in helping repulse Mihirakula, after the latter had conquered most of India, according to the reports of Chinese monk Xuanzang. In a fanciful account, Xuanzang, who wrote a century later in 630 CE, reported that Mihirakula had conquered all India except for an island where the king of Magadha named Baladitya (who could be Gupta ruler Narasimhagupta Baladitya) took refuge, but that Mihirakula was finally captured by the Indian king, who later spared his life on intercession of his mother, as she perceived the Hun ruler \"as a man of remarkable beauty and vast wisdom\". Mihirakula is then said to have returned to Kashmir to retake the throne.\n\nThis ended the Second Hunnic War circa 534, after an occupation which therefore lasted nearly 15 years.\n\nAround the middle of the 6th century CE, the Alchons withdrew to Kashmir and, pulling back from Punjab and Gandhara, went back west across the Khyber pass where they resettled in Kabulistan. There, their coinage suggests that they merged with the Nezak Huns, as coins in Nezak style now bear the Alchon tamga mark. \n\nDuring the 7th century, continued military encounters are reported between the Hunas and the northern Indian states which followed the disappearance of the Gupta Empire. For example, Prabhakaravardhana, the Vardhana dynasty king of Thanesar in northern India and father of Harsha, is reported to have been \"A lion to the Huna deer, a burning fever to the king of the Indus land\". \n\nThe Alchons in India declined rapidly around the same time that the Hephthalites, another hunnic group to the North, were defeated by an alliance between the Sassanians and the Western Turkic Kaghanate. This also follows the decline of the Huns in Europe by a few decades only.\n\nEventually, the Nezak-Alchons were replaced by the Turk shahi dynasty.\n\nThe four Alchon kings Khingila, Toramana, Javukha, and Mehama are mentionned as donators to a Buddhist stupa in the Talagan copper scroll inscription dated to 492-493 CE, that is, at a time before the Hunnic wars in India started. This corresponds to a time when the Alchons had recently taken control of Taxila (around 460 CE), at the center of the Buddhist regions of northwestern India.\n\nLater however, the attitude of the Alchons towards Buddhism is reported as very negative. Mihirakula in particular is remembered by Buddhist sources to have been a \"terrible persecutor of their religion\" in Gandhara in northern Pakistan. Under his reign, over a thousand Buddhist monasteries throughout Gandhara are said to have been destroyed. In particular the Chinese monk Xuanzang, writing in 630 CE, explained that Mihirakula ordered the destruction of Buddhism and the expulsion of monks. Indeed, the Buddhist art of Gandhara, in particular Greco-Buddhist art, becomes essentially extinct around that period. When Xuanzang visited northwestern Indian circa 630 CE, he reported that Buddhism had drastically declined, and that most of the monasteries were deserted and left in ruins.\n\nAlthough the Guptas were traditionally a Brahmanical dynasty, around the period of the invasions of the Alchon Huns, the Gupta rulers had apparently been favouring Buddhism. Narasimhagupta Baladitya, Mihirakula's supposed nemesis, was, according to contemporary writer Paramartha, brought up under the influence of the Mahayanist philosopher, Vasubandhu. He built a sangharama at Nalanda and also a high vihara with a Buddha statue within which, according to Xuanzang, resembled the \"great Vihara built under the Bodhi tree\". According to the \"Manjushrimulakalpa\" (c. 800 CE), king Narasimhsagupta became a Buddhist monk, and left the world through meditation (Dhyana). The Chinese monk Xuanzang also noted that Narasimhagupta Baladitya's son, Vajra, who commissioned a sangharama as well, \"possessed a heart firm in faith\".\nThe 12th century Kashmiri historian Kalhana too painted a dreary picture of Mihirakula's cruelty, as well as his persecution of the Buddhist faith:\nThe Alchons are generally described as sun worshipers, a traditional cult of steppe nomads, due to the appearance of sun symbols on some of their coins, combined to the probable influence they received from the cult of Surya in India. Mihirirakula is also said to have been an ardent worshiper of Shiva, although he may have been selectively attracted by the destructive powers of the Indian deity.\n\nThese invasions, although only spanning a few decades, had long term effects on India, and in a sense brought an end to Classical Indian civilization. \n\nSoon after the invasions, the Gupta Empire, already weakened by these invasions and the rise of local rulers, ended as well. Following the invasions, northern India was left in disarray, with numerous smaller Indian powers emerging after the crumbling of the Guptas.\n\nThe Huna invasions are said to have seriously damaged India's trade with Europe and Central Asia. In particular, Indo-Roman trade relations, which the Gupta Empire had greatly benefited from. The Guptas had been exporting numerous luxury products such as silk, leather goods, fur, iron products, ivory, pearl or pepper from centers such as Nasik, Paithan, Pataliputra or Benares etc. The Huna invasion probably disrupted these trade relations and the tax revenues that came with it.\n\nFurthermore, Indian urban culture was left in decline, and Buddhism, gravely weakened by the destruction of monasteries and the killing of monks, started to collapse. Great centers of learning were destroyed, such as the city of Taxila, bringing cultural regression.\n\nDuring their rule of 60 years, the Alchons are said to have altered the hierarchy of ruling families and the Indian cast system. For example, the Hunas are often said to have become the precursors of the Rajputs.\n\nAncient sources refer to the Alchons and associated groups ambiguously with various names, such as Huna in Indian texts, and Xionites in Greek texts. Xuanzang chronicled with more detail some of the later history of the Alchons. \n\nModern archeology has provided valuable insight into reconstructing the history of the Alchons. The most significant cataloguing of the Alchon dynasty came in 1967 by Robert Göbl's analysis of the coinage of the \"Iranian Huns\". This work documented the names of partial chronology of Alchon kings, beginning with Khingila. \n\nThe next significant contribution to our understanding of Alchon history came in 2006 when Gudrun Melzer and Lore Sander published their finding of the \"Talagan copper scroll\", also known as the \"Schøyen Copper Scroll\", dated to 492/3 that mentions the four Alchon kings Khingila, Toramana, Javukha, and Mehama (who was reigning at the time) as donors to a Buddhist reliquary stupa.\n\nIn 2012, the Kunsthistorisches Museum completed a reanalysis of previous finds together with a large number of new coins that appeared on the antiquities market during the Second Afghan Civil War. This work redefines the timeline and narrative of the Alchons and related peoples, and is the current authoritative work on the Iranian Huns.\n\nThe rulers of the Alchons practiced skull deformation, as evidenced from their coins, a practice shared with the Huns that migrated into Europe. The names of the first Alchon rulers do not survive. Starting from 430 CE, names of Alchon kings, assuming the title \"Tegin\", survive on coins and religious inscriptions:\n\nThe earliest Alchon Hun coins were based on Sasanian designs, often with the simple addition of the Alchon tamgha and a mention \"alchon\" or \"alkhan\". \n\nSoon however coinage of the Alchon Huns becomes original and differs from predecessors in that it is devoid of Iranian (Sasanian) symbolism. The rulers are depicted with elongated skulls, a result of artificial cranial deformation.\n\nAfter their invasion of India the coins of the Alchon Huns were numerous and varied, as they issued copper, silver and gold coins sometimes roughly following the Gupta pattern. The Alchon Huns Empire in India must have been quite significant and rich, with the ability to issue an important volume of gold coins.\n\n\n"}

A previous chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas was located in the area from at least the early 16th century, but it was deconsecrated in the 17th century. The present building was constructed between 1759 and 1762 in the Baroque style. Today, the chapel is located within the limits of Marsaskala, but it is administered by the parish of Żabbar.\n\nNotarial documents of the early 16th century suggest that a chapel dedicated to Saint Nicholas existed in the Żonqor area. This chapel formed part of the parish of St. Catherine of Żejtun, and it stood on land which belonged to Salvu Burlò. It was visited by Pietro Dusina in 1575, who found that the chapel had an altar but no door, and that it was undecorated. Burlò was ordered to install a wooden door.\n\nThis chapel was not well-maintained, and it was not used regularly, which resulted in it being profaned by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa on 25 March 1659, and again by Lorenzo D'Astiria in 1666. It remained functional for a few more years, before being profaned for a third time by Bishop Miguel Jerónimo de Molina on 25 March 1679.\n\nThe present building was built by the lawyer Giovanni Battista Azzopardi Barbara, in order to fulfill the wish of his father, Gian Francesco. The first stone was laid down on 10 July 1759 by monsignor Giovanni Maria Azzopardi Castelletti. It was completed within three years, being was consecrated in 1762. The chapel was presumably built to serve the religious needs of farmers who lived in the area, and it is sometimes known as \"Tas-Subriċint\". At some point, a plaque stating \"non gode l'immunita ecclesias\" was installed near the doorway to indicate that the chapel did not enjoy ecclesiastical immunity.\n\nThe chapel was damaged during World War II, and it was repaired in November 1945. For some time, Society of Christian Doctrine members from Żabbar used the chapel for retreats.\n\nToday, the chapel is located within the limits of Marsaskala, but it forms part of the parish of Żabbar. The chapel is open on Friday evenings for rosary or adoration, and mass is held there once every month. The chapel is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. It is erroneously listed twice with inventory numbers 1741 and 2102, under the localities of Marsaskala and Żabbar respectively.\n\nThe chapel is built in the Baroque style out of local limestone. The chapel is a rectangular building, and it has a small cylindrical dome with a lantern. The façade contains the main portal, which is flanked by two sets of flat pilasters set on plinths. The doorway is set in the central bay, and it is decorated by mouldings and topped with a pediment. A window which illuminates the chapel is found above the door. A wide entablature topped by a cornice runs along the entire façade, and another triangular pediment tops the central bay. \n\nThis is decorated with the coat of arms of Bishop Bartolomé Rull, surmounted by the arms of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca. A plaque with a Latin inscription commemorating the chapel's completion is found above the main doorway, while a longer inscription describing the course of construction is located inside the chapel.\n\nThe chapel's altarpiece depicts Saint Nicholas wearing a bishop's clothing, and it is attributed to Mattia Preti. The original painting is now in the Żabbar Sanctuary Museum, and a copy by Michael Mifsud is located inside the chapel.\n\nA small wooden statue of Saint Nicholas from the old chapel was moved to the Żabbar Sanctuary in the 17th century, but was placed in the new chapel once this was completed. This was eventually moved to the Żabbar Sanctuary Museum, and another statue of the saint is found in the chapel.\n"}

George's father John was the first to use the spelling McLennan; his predecessors had used the spelling MacLennan.\n\nGeorge's mother Elizabeth died when he was young, and his father remarried a widow with two children and subsequently had three more children with her. Among his half-siblings was Gold Medal winner Donald Ross McLennan. George suffered from polio as a child, and could not walk until the age of four and a half.\n\nMcLennan began receiving piping tuition from his father at the age of four, and later received tuition from his uncle Pipe Major John Stewart, and in Highland dancing from his cousin William McLennan. He made rapid progression, winning the Amateur National Championship at the age of nine, and was invited by Queen Victoria to play for her at Balmoral Castle.\n\nHis father enlisted him in the Gordon Highlanders in October 1899 in order to prevent him from joining the Merchant Navy, and he became Pipe major of the 1st Battalion in 1905, one of the youngest ever in the British Army.\n\nMcLennan was successful in solo competitions, and won the Gold Medal at the Argyllshire Gathering in Oban in 1904 and at the Northern Meeting in Inverness in 1905, and the Clasp at Inverness for former winners of the Gold Medal in 1909, 1920 and 1921. McLennan had a close friendship and competitive rivalry with Willie Ross, and he travelled to competitions and shared prize money with William Lawrie.\n\nHe married Nona Lucking on 3 April 1912, and together they had two sons, George (1914–1996) and John (1916–1940), who both became pipers with the Gordon Highlanders.\n\nMcLennan was posted at the depot in Aberdeen until 1918, when he was sent to the Western Front to succeed Pipe Major Tom Henderson who had been killed. In May 1918 he collapsed and required fluid to be drained from his lungs in a field hospital. When the war ended he was posted back to Aberdeen, and after he was discharged in 1922 he started working in Aberdeen as a bagpipe maker, at a shop at 2 Bath Street. At the time there were several other prominent musicians in the city, including fiddler James Scott Skinner.\n\nHe died on 31 May 1929 of lung cancer after a long period of ill health connected to the makeshift operation. 20,000 people lined the route of the procession to Aberdeen station at his funeral on the 4th of June, before he was interred at Newington Cemetery in Edinburgh.\n\nG. S. McLennan was a composer of both pibroch and ceòl beag (light music). He inherited views on pibroch playing from his father, who had written two books on the subject. John was critical of the style espoused by the newly formed Piobaireachd Society, and believed it to be too slow and rhythmically loose. G. S. McLennan would step in time to pibroch as he played, which is not normally done. He also significantly developed the style of light music with his compositions, making it more varied and technically demanding.\n\nHis technical ability was extraordinary, and it is said that his fingers could be heard distinctly on the chanter when he played. Donald MacLeod described McLennan as \"the most complete piper of this century\".\n\nMany of his compositions are widely played today, and include\n\n"}
