The STANAG, and its supporting NATO publications, provides guidance on managing the configuration of products and services. It is unique in its perspective, requiring a Life Cycle CM Plan, and in its approach to contracting for CM, using an ISO standard as the base, and building-up additional requirements (as opposed to the classical tailoring-down).\n\nSTANAG 4427 is NATO’s agreement on how to do configuration management on defense systems. Edition 1 was originally promulgated in 1997 and updated with Edition 2 in 2007. The first iteration of the Standardization Agreement was entitled Introduction of Allied Configuration Management Publications (ACMPs), and it called on ratifying nations to use seven NATO publications (ACMP 1-7) as the agreed upon contractual clauses for configuration management. \n\nIn 2010, NATO undertook to review and revise the STANAGs and ACMPs with two major assignments: make the NATO guidance useful and extend the guidance through the full project life cycle. This work resulted in the promulgation of STANAG 4427 Edition 3, Configuration Management in System Life Cycle Management, in 2014. As of 2017, it has been ratified by 19 nations.\n\nWith Edition 3, NATO published three new ACMPs: ACMP-2000, Policy on Configuration Management; ACMP-2009, Guidance on Configuration Management; and ACMP-2100, Configuration Management Contractual Requirements. This trio of publications uses a civil standard as the platform (ISO 10007), requires the acquirer to prepare and maintain a Life Cycle CM Plan for the system, to use a combination of governance and insight that is required to achieve the specific system objectives, and to build-up contractual requirements based on defined needs, rather than boilerplates.\n\nNATO publications covered by STANAG 4427 Edition 3\n\nCopies of NATO Configuration Management publications are available at the NATO Standardization Office web site:\n \n"}

{"id": "54288542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54288542", "title": "Jack Clowes", "text": "Jack Clowes\n\nJack Clowes (31 July 1866 – 10 March 1927), was a rugby union footballer of the 1880s, who played in Yorkshire for Halifax, and was selected to play at a representative level for the British Isles on the 1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia, the first tour by a team representing the British Isles. Cowles is notable for having been prohibited from playing on that 1888 tour due to the Rugby Football Union deeming him a professional, and for the subsequent ramifications of his case contributing to the creation of the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895.\n\nJohn William Preston Clowes was born on 31 July 1866 in Philadelphia, as a British subject, the eldest son of Stephen Clowes and Mary (nee Preston). His parents were both from Leicestershire – Shearsby and Kilby respectively – and, after marrying in 1865, left for the United States of America, arriving in New York on 6 November 1865. John was born the next year in Philadelphia. By 1871, John had moved to England and was living in Shearsby with his paternal grandparents. By 1881 John was resident with his maternal grandparents in Kilby. His mother, having returned from the United States, remarried to William Jayes and moved to Halifax in Yorkshire where John later joined her. He became a factory worked and a mechanic.\n\nJack Clowes began playing rugby football at the age of 16, joining the Halifax Free Wanderers, at the time a very good junior team. After playing two seasons with the Wanderers he joined the Halifax Club in 1884. He was a member of the team that won the Yorkshire Challenge Cup in 1886 and hardly missed a game for the club for the next two years. In 1888 he was selected to play for Yorkshire County, making his début against Somerset. Playing as a forward, he was very fast, an expert dribbler and a good tackler. He was considered to be one of the best rising players in the North of England in 1888, and was the leading scorer for Halifax in that season, leading to his selection for the British team's tour to New Zealand and Australia.\n\nThe 1888 tour was organized by two cricket professionals, Arthur Shrewsbury and Alfred Shaw, who had little appreciation of the seriousness with which the RFU took the amateur ideal. They had appointed an agent to recruit the players and pay them a clothing allowance of £15 each. Before the tour began, Halifax played Dewsbury in the second round of the Yorkshire Cup. Two of Dewsbury's players, William Stadden and Angus Stuart, the latter who had also been selected for the British Isles team, were withdrawn from playing in the cup match by the president of Dewsbury, Mark Newsome after he had learned from Stuart of the £15 allowance. Dewsbury lost the match and Newsome subsequently appealed the result on the grounds that Halifax had fielded a professional in the person of Clowes. Clowes subsequently appeared before the Yorkshire Committee and admitted everything, and offered to pay back the £15. However, the RFU later judged him to be a professional but the news did not reach him until he was aboard the Kaikoura having set sail with the touring party. The rules of the day were such that, if one professional was deemed to have played in a match then the whole side was deemed professional. As such, Clowes was forbidden from playing any games on the tour. Shrewsbury even commented to Shaw of Clowes \"he is a dead head and of no use to us at all\".\n\nOn the teams return in November 1888 there was still much confusion as to the status of the tourists. However, the RFU simply lifted the ban on Clowes and called on the other tourists to sign declarartions that they had only received no money other than expenses whilst on tour. With every member so-swearing the matter was dropped. The inconsistent manner in which the RFU had dealt with the matter instigated a reaction in Yorkshire whereby the Yorkshire Rugby Union became more determined and zealous in their pursuit of stamping out professionalism. Several instances where their interpretation of professionalism was deemed too broad or where the punishment they rendered deemed too harsh, eventually led to a number of clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire breaking away to form the North Rugby Football Union.\n\nIn 1889, Clowes was badly injured in an industrial accident that almost ended his career. In 1901 he was listed as still living with his mother and stepfather and working as a mechanic. Clowes died on 10 March 1927 in Cheshire.\n"}

{"id": "54288556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54288556", "title": "Balloon syndrome", "text": "Balloon syndrome\n\nBalloon syndrome is a rare condition in hedgehogs in which gas is trapped under the skin as a result of injury or infection, causing the animal to inflate. The British Hedgehog Preservation Society describes the symptoms as, \"Hedgehog has blown up appearance, subcutaneous emphysema\".\n\nIn 2017 the BBC reported a case in which a male hedgehog was \"almost twice its natural size, literally blown up like a beach ball with incredibly taut skin\". The head vet at Stapeley's Wildlife Hospital, Bev Panto, said, \"In my career I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking […] When you first see them they appear to be very big hedgehogs but when you pick them up they feel so light because they are mostly air\". She added that the condition was unique to hedgehogs because they have significant space under their skin as a result of their ability to curl up. A similar case had been reported in 2013. \n\nThe British Hedgehog Preservation Society advises that: \"There is no single cause for this condition. The air can be removed by incising or aspirating through the skin over the back. Antibiotic cover should be given. This may be associated with lung/chest wall damage or a small external wound acting like a valve or a clostridium type infection\". Incisions in the affected parts of the hedgehog will allow the trapped air to escape, but these must remain open until after the animal's lungs have healed to prevent recurrence of the syndrome.\n\nIn July 2017 Live Science reported Romain Pizzi, the specialist wildlife veterinary surgeon at the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Scottish SPCA), saying that, \"Hedgehogs have a little windpipe that runs from their mouth and nose to their lungs, and at the top of this windpipe is the glottis, which opens and closes as hedgehogs breathe. […] If a hedgehog is struck when that glottis is open, air simply flows out of the lungs and out of the body. But if the glottis is closed when the animal is struck, that air has nowhere to go, and the lung tissue can rupture. It's like a balloon popping. […] This trauma can also cause damage to the muscles in between a hedgehog's ribs\". Live Science added that \"the ruptures in the lungs and rib muscles [according to Pizzi] 'act like a one-way valve,' so air can flow out of the lungs and into the body cavity — but not back in. So, with each breath the hedgehog takes, a bit of air leaks out, causing the hedgehog to inflate itself. […] Pizzi noted that the tissue under a hedgehog's skin isn't designed to be filled with air, so it's not one big open compartment. Instead, there is a lot of connective tissue under the skin, sectioning areas off into little compartments of air. Though it's called balloon syndrome, in most cases the hedgehogs 'puff up more like Bubble Wrap,' he said\".\n"}
