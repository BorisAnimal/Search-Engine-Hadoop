{"id": "54297730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54297730", "title": "Pterostylis angusta", "text": "Pterostylis angusta\n\nPterostylis angusta, commonly known as the narrow shell orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. In this species the flower is green, white and brown with an inflated base, a narrow hood and the longest labellum of any Western Australian \"Pterostylis\" species.\n\n\"Pterostylis angusta\" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of dark bluish-green leaves lying flat on the ground. Each leaf is long and wide. Flowering plants usually only have a single flower long and wide which leans slightly forwards on a flowering stem high with between three and seven stem leaves. The flowers are green and white, brownish near the tip. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \"galea\" over the column. The base of the galea is inflated and the top is narrow with a sharply-pointed end. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea and have narrow tips long and a V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide and curved, and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from late May to July.\n\n\"Pterostylis angusta\" was first formally described in 1971 by Alex George from a specimen collected near Mount Trio in the Stirling Range and the description was published in \"Nuytsia\". The specific epithet (\"angusta\") is a Latin word meaning \"narrow\", referring to the narrow galea.\n\nThe narrow shell orchid grows in two disjunct areas in the Jarrah Forest biogeographic region, one between Brookton and the Stirling Range and the other between Australind and Capel. It mostly grows in woodland, often in sandy soil.\n\n\"Pterostylis angusta\" is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.\n"}

It was founded in 1838 and is part of the Archdiocese of Baltimore.\n\nIt is a two-story ashlar granite church which faces north. It is three bays wide and four bays deep. Its front facade includes two twin Roman arch windows each topped by a rose window, enclosed within a roman arch lintel with keystone.\n\nSaint Paul Catholic Church was constructed on land in Ellicott City acquired from George Ellicott, an early settler of the region. The first pastor of the church was the Rev. Henry Coskery, who prior to the establishment of the parish celebrated Mass at the nearby Castle Angelo. The church was dedicated on December 13, 1838 as the only Catholic parish between Baltimore and Frederick, Maryland. It is now the oldest active Catholic parish between Baltimore and Pittsburgh.\n\nCoskery also founded the Christian Brothers' Rock Hill College in 1857.\n\nThe Rev. Augustin Verot served as pastor of the church from 1853 to 1858, and was succeeded immediately by the Rev. John Samuel Foley, who served until 1863. Both later became bishops. During the American Civil War, the basement of the church served as a hospital for both Union and Confederate soldiers.\n\nDuring the pastorate of the Rev. Peter Tarro (1883-1907), several structural improvements were made to the church building. Three marble altars were added to the church, as were new pews, a confessional, Statues and Stations of the Cross, stained-glass windows, a baptistery, and a church spire.\n\nIn the early 1900s, many couples who eloped came to St. Paul's to get married. On October 14, 1914, Babe Ruth and his bride Margaret Helen Woodford were married in St. Paul's by the church's pastor, the Rev. Thomas Dolan. He was 19 at the time and she was 17. Ruth, who was known to fabricate certain elements of his personal history, later claimed that he \"married [his] first wife in Elkton.\" However, the marriage certificate lists Ellicott City as the place of his marriage. A copy of the marriage certificate is exhibited by St. Paul's in the church narthex.\n\nThe church is included in the local Ellicott City Historic District. In a 1977 draft nomination for the church to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places (which appears not ever to have been submitted), it was noted that \"In addition to its historical merit it is an outstanding example of American eclectic architecture, blending elements of the Gothic and Romanesque in its fenestration and entrances with simple granite architecture so indigenous to Howard County.\"\n\nSt. Paul's Church created a chapel for the students of Rock Hill College in 1859. The side chapel eventually became part of the church proper.\n\nSt. Paul's served as a refuge for people during the Ellicott City flood that took place on July 30, 2016. The church's pastor, the Rev. Warren Tanghe, opened one of the church's buildings to people fleeing the floodwaters. Over 50 people stayed in the church. 2 people died in the flood. It hosted flood recovery activity in 2017.\n\nWhat is now Resurrection-St. Paul School was founded as St. Paul Parish School in 1922 at the direction of the St. Paul's pastor, the Rev. Michael Ryan. In its early days it was staffed by the School Sisters of Notre Dame. In 1966, due to the growth of the school population and the lack of space on the St. Paul's property, the location was moved to Paulskirk Drive in Ellicott City, and the school was renamed St. Paul the Apostle School. In 1974, the Church of the Resurrection parish was established on the same property as the school, and it was renamed Resurrection School. In January 1990, the name was changed once more to Resurrection-St. Paul School. It is now fully supported by both parishes, and teaches students from PreK through 8th grade. In 2016, the school's enrollment was 425 students.\n\nThe following men served as pastor of St. Paul's:\n"}

The lot fell on the daughter of Lyciscus; but Epebolus, the seer, pronounced her to be unfit for the sacrifice, as being no daughter of Lyciscus at all, but a supposititious child. Meanwhile, Lyciscus, in alarm, took the maiden with him and withdrew to Sparta. Here she died; and several years after, as he was visiting her tomb, to which he often resorted, he was seized by some Arcadian horsemen, carried back to Ithome, and put upon his trial for treason. His defense was, that he had fled, not as being hostile to his country or indifferent to her fate, but in the full belief of what Epebolus had declared. This being unexpectedly confirmed by the priestess of Hera, who confessed that she was herself the mother of the girl, Lyciscus was acquitted.\n"}
